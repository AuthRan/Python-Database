These are Python Projects I used to implement different ways to work with data in python

# 🎥 YouTube Manager – Python Projects

A simple command-line YouTube Manager built in **three different versions** to explore multiple data storage methods:
- **JSON** (file-based storage)
- **SQLite** (SQL database)
- **MongoDB** (NoSQL database)

Each version lets you:
- 📜 List your favorite videos
- ➕ Add a new video
- ✏️ Edit/Update a video
- ❌ Delete a video
- 💾 Save changes permanently

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/youtube-manager.git
cd youtube-manager

```

💡 Why I Built This
I started with the JSON version while following my instructor,
then challenged myself to rebuild it on my own using SQLite3 and MongoDB.

This helped me understand:
CRUD operations in Python
